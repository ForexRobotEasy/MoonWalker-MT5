## Functionality

The MoonWalker MT5 Expert Advisor performs various tasks to facilitate nighttime scalping trades and automate trading processes. Here is an overview of the functions implemented in the code:

1. **OnInit**: This is the initialization function that is called when the Expert Advisor is launched. It performs the following tasks:
   - Checks if the current time is within the two-hour window of lowest volatility.
   - If the current time is within the specified window, it calls the `PerformScalpingTrades` function to execute nighttime scalping trades.
   - Calls the `SwitchPairsMonthly` function to switch pairs every month.
   - Calls the `DetectTimeZone` function to detect the time zone and daylight saving time.
   - Calls the `PlaceSingleOrder` function to ensure only one order is placed at a time.

2. **IsNighttime**: This function checks if the current time is within the two-hour window of lowest volatility. It compares the current time with the start and end times specified for nighttime scalping. If the current time falls within this window, it returns `true`, indicating that nighttime scalping trades can be performed.

3. **PerformScalpingTrades**: This function is called when the current time is within the two-hour window of lowest volatility. It is responsible for executing nighttime scalping trades based on a specific scalping strategy. You can customize this function to implement your own scalping trading logic.

4. **SwitchPairsMonthly**: This function is called to switch pairs every month. You can add your code to switch pairs based on your trading strategy.

5. **DetectTimeZone**: This function is responsible for detecting the time zone and daylight saving time. You can add your code to detect the time zone based on your trading requirements.

6. **PlaceSingleOrder**: This function ensures that only one order is placed at a time. You can customize this function to implement your own order placement logic.
